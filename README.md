# 🃏 Card Matching Game — Submission

This is my submission for the card-matching game assignment.

## ✅ Implemented Features:
- Card flipping and matching animations
- Turn and match scoring system
- Sound effects: flip, match, mismatch, game over
- Game completion detection and restart button
- Unity 2022.3.23f1 (LTS-compatible)
- Git commit history reflecting development steps

## ⚠️ Not Implemented:
- Save/load system
- Dynamic responsive layouts for various screen sizes
- Continuous flipping during match checks (disabled to prevent logic issues)

> Due to limited time and a short period of personal sickness during development, I was unable to complete the above features.


## How to Play:
1. Click to flip cards and find matching pairs.
2. Matches stay face-up; mismatches flip back.
3. After all matches are found, the game ends with a restart option.
